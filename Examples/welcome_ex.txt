# Welcome to Mango

Mango is in a very early state of development right now, but it's got some pretty cool features so far!

## What's Up Doc?

First and foremost, mango can render *simple* markdown text with **ease**

New setions will appear as separate elements in the render display DOM.

## The Meat and Potatoes

Here's where Mango starts to excel. Mango had powerful KaTeX integration built right it. Simply bound an expression in $2$ dollar signs and KaTeX will detect the mathematics as $ x + 1 $ such (even with leading and trailing spaces.

More than that, Mango is beginning to see autodetection of math within elements. x=3 and \vec{v} are examples of expressions that Mango has automatically identified as mathematics and rendered inline

# Other

Mango of course knows when blocks are math, no delimiters required

f(x) = x^2+2x+1
=(x+1)^2

And will automatically render the portion with KaTeX's block rendering.

## Much more to come

Including snippets \R^n among many other things!
