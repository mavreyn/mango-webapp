# So this is the ultimate thing
I finally got something working *here* let's see it in action

## 1.1 Linear Lines and stuf

Ok so we got this equation

y = mx+b

This is what we call standard form

the solution (root) can be written as

x = \frac{-b}{m}

And this is awesome

### Finding a value

So if **U** want to actually find a value for the function at a point, plugging in a number will simply suffice.

Take:

x = 3, m = 2, b = -4

Thus we have

y = mx+b
=(2)(3)+(-4)
= 6-4
=2
