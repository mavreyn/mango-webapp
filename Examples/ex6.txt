# Mango test
Welcome to Mango! this is going to be a little bit about what the app is about and basically just an overview of my efforts

## Here we go!

Basically, I write Mango to be able to detect if a block of math is math without delimiting it. Suppose we have the equation

ax^2+bx+c=0

and we want to find the roots. It is a tricky process, but it can be written as follows:

x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}

## Alternate version of the formula
Rearranging, the formula becomes:

x=\left(\frac{-b}{2a}\right)\pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{-b}{2a}\right) - \frac{c}{a}}

# But wait there's more!

This actually supports scroll sync which is a great way to actually make stuff happen and good stuff!

So the boiler place is almost done and then we can get to the fun stuff

## Linear Stuffs

Lets say we have a linear function

y=mx+b

and I want to actually find the solution to this

The solution is going to be equal to:

x = \frac{-b}{m}

And that folks is about as simple as it will get
