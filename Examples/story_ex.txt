So this is what typing looks like. A normal person typing would be able to go about normally and have absolutely no idea of the Power of Mango! Maybe they would figure out with a little bit of time that the can *make* some words italic and **some other sections** bold as they please

# And even Better

Since Mango uses markdown rendering with showdown, the user would be pleased to figure this out

Eventually, maybe the user would end up typing a phrase like x=3 and they would find that it renders a little differently that other phrases. They could even type something more complex and intricate such as f(x)=x^2+bx+c and they would find that it renders just as well inline without any delimiters!

## Blocks

Blocks can be created as such:

4x+2y=5
3x-y=12

And it would be formatted incredibly well. Typing math in this way is literally effortless and so easy for the user.

Even More complicated expressions such as

A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}

Work absolutely beautifully

## Matrix and Linear Algebra

Typing column vectors is a sinch with Mango, Use the notation:

[1 2 3] \in \R^3

to create a simple column vector

It even supports more complex abilities such as vdots when used within the notation

[x_1 x_2 ... x_n] \in  \R^n

And it takes hardly any time at all, being very natural for the user!
