So this is what typing looks like. A normal person typing would be able to go about normally and have absolutely no idea of the Power of Mango! Maybe they would figure out with a little bit of time that the can *make* some words italic and **some other sections** bold as they please

# And even Better

Since Mango uses markdown rendering with showdown, the user would be pleased to figure this out

Eventually, maybe the user would end up typing a phrase like x=3 and they would find that it renders a little differently that other phrases. They could even type something more complex and intricate such as f(x)=x^2+bx+c and they would find that it renders just as well inline without any delimiters!

## Blocks

Blocks can be created as such:

4x+2y=5
3x-y=12

And it would be formatted incredibly well. Typing math in this way is literally effortless and so easy for the user.

Even More complicated expressions such as

A \vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}

Work absolutely beautifully. They work A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v} inline as well.

## Matrix and Linear Algebra

Typing column vectors is a sinch with Mango, Use the notation:

[1 2 3] \in \R^3

to create a simple column vector

It even supports more complex abilities such as vdots when used within the notation

[x_1 x_2 ... x_n] \in  \R^n

And it takes hardly any time at all, being very natural for the user! But this aspect is seriously important for matrix/lin alg classes

So Mango 

Here is the greatest test to make things happen \sum_0^1\pi = \pi because since x=4. That is literally so random I just pulled that out of nowhere

Let x=1 and let \vec{v} be a vector

f(x) = 7

It works quite well even with its \frac{1}{2} native algorithm. But there are some flaws that: I noticed

[1 0 0 1] \in \R^4

f(x) =mx+b

a=[1 2 3] \cdot [4 5 6]
= 1 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 6
=4+10+18
=32

# Limitations

- Quite a number, the most prominent of which is that every time a snippet is typed and converted, it puts the cursor at the end of the textarea which can get bothersome.
- Thinking about bringing the whole snippets thing to a middle step so no actual on screen conversion is seen at all, like I already do for column vectors
- When you type with in bullets sometimes the < /li> tag shows up which is weird, thinkinga boutmoving the MD to after the KaTeX to hopefully prevent that, should be an easy fix
