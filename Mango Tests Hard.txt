# Gaussian integrals

We are going to be talking today about gaussian integrals over a 2D domain fancyD

It is also known as the euler-poisson integral and there are a few cool representations of it. One of which is the following:

Isubnofa === int 0 inf of exp -axsr xpown dx

Here's anotehr cool one

int INF exp-xsr dx = rtpi

And this

I2of@a = int 0 +inf xsr exp-@axsr dx = 1/4 rt pi/@acb

fx = int 0 x of f't dt

f'3 = lim h to 0 (3+h)sr-3sr/h
=lim h to 0 9+6h+hsr-9/h
=lim h to 0 6h+hsr/h
=lim h to 0 (6+h)
=6

d/dx sin-1x = 1/rt1-xsr , x =! +- 1

d/dx csc-1x = -1/|x|rtxsr-1 , x != +- 1,0

int xpown expcx dx = 1/c xpown expcx - n/c int xpown-1 expcx dx
=(del/delc)pown expcx/c
=epowcx sum i=0 n (-1)powi n!/(n-i)!cpowi+1 xpown-i
=epowcx sum i=0 n (-1)pown-i n!/i!cpown-i+1 xpowi

int 1/1+sinx dx = int 1-sinx/cossrx dx
=int 1/cossrx - sinx/cosx 1/cosx dx
=int secsrx - tanx secx dx
= tanx - secx + C

int xsinxdx = -xcosx - int -cosx dx
= -xcosx+sinx+C

int from pi/3 to pi/2 of xsinx dx = [-xcosx+sinx]EVAL pi/3 pi/2
=[(-pi/2)(cos pi/2) + sin pi/2]-[(-pi/3)(cos pi/3) + sin pi/3]
=(0+1)-(-pi/6 + rt3/2)
=1+pi/6 - rt3/2
=6-3rt3+pi/6

# And that's all she wrote!
=========================================
int xsrdx = xcb/3 +C

int 0 1 of x = xsr/2

int INF exp-xsr dx = pisr/6
